# C+-



A personal project trying to be a programming language with close resemblence to C/C++ (probably gonna fail at that).

## What I want the programming language to  be
 I want it to be:

 * An imperative programming language(obviously)
 * Statically typed
 * I want it to be able to be used in bigger projects but also small scripts
 * Have close syntax to C++ but with more features, but also easier to read.


  But for now I want it to be able at least to be close to assembly so it can actually do stuff.

## Technologies
 For now it is being built with C.

# C+-

  ![alt text](https://github.com/koreaneggroll/C-plus-minus/blob/main/logo.jpeg?raw=true)

A personal project trying to be a programming language with close resemblence to C/C++ (probably gonna fail at that).

## Side note
 This project will probably get some commits in one day and then none for another day. That's because i'm also working on my other project *teamlearn* https://github.com/teamlearncoding/teamlearn.

## What I want the programming language to  be
 I want it to be:

 * An imperative programming language(obviously)
 * Statically typed
 * I want it to be able to be used in bigger projects but also small scripts
 * Have close syntax to C++ but with more features, but also easier to read.


  But for now I want it to be able at least to be close to assembly so it can actually do stuff.

## Technologies
 For now it is being built with C.

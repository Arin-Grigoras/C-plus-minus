## Get Started : how to install the transpiler
  The transpiler can be obtained by either getting the latest release of it. Or by running the following commands
    

     git clone https://github.com/koreaneggroll/C-star.git
     cd C-star
     make


  And now to access the transpiler globally:
     

     sudo cp ./gss /usr/local/bin


  And now you can use it freely on any file you want.

## Get Started : how to install the transpiler
  The compiler can be obtained by either getting the latest release of it on the github page. Or by running the following commands
    

     git clone https://github.com/koreaneggroll/C-Plus-Minus.git
     cd C-Plus-Minus
     make


  And now to access the transpiler globally:
     

     sudo cp ./cpm /usr/local/bin


  And now you can use it freely on any file you want.
